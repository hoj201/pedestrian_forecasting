    "Note the array conventions have changed a bit.  In particular, the routines are vectorized in $x_0$ and $x_t$ respectively, where we assume $x_0$ is a $2\\times N$ array (rather than an $N \\times 2$ array).  The reasons for this change are questionable perhaps.  I think it made some things more convenient that I was coding at the time, but then it made other things less so."
